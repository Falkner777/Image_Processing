# Image Processing
A Two Part Project for an image processing university course.

## Part A
A set of 6 exercises that involved creating image processing techniques from scratch without the usage of library functions(on most cases).

- Filtering in Frequency Domain
- Image Compressiong using Discrete Cosine Transform
- Image Denoising using moving average and median filters
- Fourier Descriptors for image detection
- Wiener Filtering
- Image detection from database

## Part B
A classification project using the MNIST Dataset using two classifiers:
1. A deep learning approach using a convolution neural network
2. A machine learning approach using a support vector machine

Git Navigation:
Results: The image processing result diagrams
MnistDataset: Contains all the train and test data from the dataset
PartA/PartB: The code for each part

The ```requirements.txt``` contains the necessary libraries for the project
